* NextAuth is a library used to do authentication in NextJS
* Popoular choices while doing auth include - 
External provider - 
1. https://auth0.com/
2. https://clerk.com/
3. Firebase auth

- We cannot use session inside a server component if we try to use it we will get error
- So to use session in server components we have to import this
import { getServerSession } from "next-auth"
